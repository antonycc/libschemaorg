/**
 * MedicalContraindication
 *
 * A condition or factor that serves as a reason to withhold a certain medical therapy. Contraindications can be absolute (there are no reasonable circumstances for undertaking a course of action) or relative (the patient is at higher risk of complications, but that these risks may be outweighed by other considerations or mitigated by other measures).
